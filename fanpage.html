      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <p>
        Glass Animals are an English indie rock band formed in Oxford in 2010.
        Led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Bayley, the group also
        features his childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew
        MacFarlane. Bayley wrote and produced all three Glass Animals albums.
        Bayley spent his childhood in Massachusetts and Texas[3] before
        relocating to Oxford, where he met the other band members at school.[4]
        Their first album, Zaba (2014), spawned the single "Gooey", which was
        eventually certified platinum in the United States. Their second full
        album, How to Be a Human Being, received positive reviews and won in two
        categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self
        Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize
        shortlist. The third, Dreamland, peaked at number two on the UK Albums
        Chart and number seven on the US Billboard 200.

        In their live shows they play re-worked, dance-heavy versions of their
        songs. Their song "Heat Waves" reached number one in Australia in
        February 2021 and was voted number one on the Triple J Hottest 100 of
        2020. The song surpassed one billion streams on Spotify[5] and
        eventually reached number one in the US Billboard Hot 100 and number
        five on the UK Singles Chart. At the 2022 Brit Awards, Glass Animals
        were nominated for two Brit Awards (Best British Rock Act and "Heat
        Waves" for Best British Single).[6] They received their first Grammy
        nomination in the Best New Artist category at the 2022 Grammy Awards.
